If you are unfamiliar with Hugo, it is a static site generator. A static site is a website that does not connect to a backend server - ie, the website does not dynamically change and all of the elements are fixed in place at the time of render/compilation.\nThe core of Hugo is built around markdown files. We will see more detail on this later but for now just understand that Hugo uses these markdown files to render each page or post on our website.\nCreating a Hugo Project Note: The Hugo documentation  goes into much more detail than I will be able to here. I am using a macOS system so I am unable to definitively explain the install process on other operating systems. Once you have the installation completed, all of the following steps will be identical, regardless of operating system. If you have questions, feel free to reach out using the contact page  and I will do my best to respond.\nStep 1: Version Control It is highly recommended to use a version control system for keeping up with changes to your website and it is required if you would like to host your site on a service like Netlify . If you do not already know how to use GitHub, please read through my post on setting up your first repository .\nStep 2: Installation Run the installation command below. Remember - this is for macOS, so your command may differ.\nbrew install hugo To verify your installation, run the following:\nhugo version output:\n➜ hugo git:(main) ✗ hugo version hugo v0.92.1+extended darwin/amd64 BuildDate=unknown Step 3: Create a New Site hugo new site my-blog -f yml # note: -f allows you to choose the file extension of your config file # the default is toml but I prefer yaml This command will create a new site folder called my-blog in the directory from which you ran the script. For example, if we created a new website in the www folder, the file structure would be:\n📂 www 📂 my-blog 📂 archetypes 📂 content 📂 layouts 📂 themes 📂 data 📂 static 📄 config.yml Step 4: Picking a Theme Something to note is that Hugo does not come with a theme out of the box. So, before you get started on creating the content of your pages, you will need to head to https://themes.gohugo.io/  and choose a theme that fits your site.\nI am using the PaperMod theme , created by Aditya Telange . For the sake of this demo, this is the theme that we will be using as it has a variety of features (search, categories, tags, etc) and it is pretty easy to get working.\n  Start by cloning the theme’s GitHub repository to your themes folder. This can be done a variety of ways but I prefer using GitHub’s submodule feature - think of it like nested repositories.\ngit submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod --depth=1 git submodule update --init --recursive # needed when you reclone your repo (submodules may not get cloned automatically) Once you have added the submodule, you should now see a new entry has been appended to your .gitmodules file and your themes folder now looks something like this:\n📂 themes 📂 PaperMod 📂 .github 📂 assets 📂 i18n 📂 images 📂 layouts 📄 go.mod 📄 LICENSE 📄 README.md If you ever need to update the theme, run:\ngit submodule update --remote --merge   Next, we must alter the sites config.yml to use this new theme. The config file allows us to take advantage of the features that come bundled with the theme - and by setting certain variables, we can activate or modify these features. Below is an example of how I have my config setup but this is not the only way to do it, as you may need more or less features than I do. I strongly suggest checking if your theme has an example config file on the GitHub page that you downloaded the theme from.\n This is going to be a lot of text - skip to next step ⬇️     baseURL: \"https://kmclester.com/\" # NOTE: include only if you have a custom domain title: My Blog paginate: 5 theme: PaperMod enableInlineShortcodes: true enableRobotsTXT: true buildDrafts: false buildFuture: false buildExpired: false enableEmoji: true googleAnalytics: G-06XXXXXXS minify: disableXML: true minifyOutput: true languages: en: languageName: \"English\" weight: 1 menu: main: - name: Archive url: archives weight: 5 - name: Search url: search/ weight: 10 - name: Tags url: tags/ weight: 10 - name: Categories url: categories/ weight: 10 outputs: home: - HTML - RSS - JSON params: env: production description: \"Personal blog\" author: Kyle McLester defaultTheme: auto ShowShareButtons: true ShowReadingTime: true displayFullLangName: true ShowPostNavLinks: true ShowBreadCrumbs: true ShowCodeCopyButtons: true ShowToc: true homeInfoParams: Title: \"Welcome!\" Content: This website is going to act as a dumping ground for things I'm learning or working on.

Most themes come with default posts that can provide you with more information on how to use Hugo, the theme you selected, etc. - I would strongly recommend at least reading through some of these pages before creating your own content.\nCreating Content This is great but how do we actually make any webpages? The main folder that you will be working in is the content folder - this is where all of the pages/posts on your website will be kept.\nOpen the project directory in your favorite text editor or IDE - I’m using VS Code for this project. Now, you can open any file in the /content/posts directory to begin editing files. Every time you save, the website will automatically update with the new content.\nWith this in mind, you can begin creating your own webpages.\nFeel free to delete the included posts and begin making your own. Just remember, we are using markdown so you will need to create a new file with the .md file extension. Once you’ve created your file, you will need to set the pages \u0026ldquo;front matter\u0026rdquo; . The front matter is what allows you to attach meta data to your posts, as well as alter the configuration of a page. This is going to vary from theme to theme but I tend to use this for my pages:\n--- author: Kyle McLester date: 2022-02-21 format: hugo title: Creating a Personal Blog Site categories: - Web Development tags: - hugo - blog - personal website - markdown - netlify summary: Creating Your First Hugo Site --- Note - the three dashes above and below the front matter are formatted for yaml code. Which symbol to use depends on the format of your config file. If you are using toml, you would use +++ and json uses { }.\nThe front matter should be followed by a single new line and then your content. Checkout my github of this page  to see further example of how to format your markdown file(s).\nHosting with Netlify Incase you haven’t done so already, create a git repo for this project. As a quick refresher, feel free to follow the steps below:\n Go to GitHub and create a new repo In your root project directory, run git init Now add all of your files/changes by running git add . Commit your changes: git commit -m \"Initial commit\" Set branch to main: git branch -M main Add remote origin: git remote add origin  Push changes to remote repo: git push origin main  Now head on over to Netlify  and create an accout/login.\nOnce you have logged in, you should be greeted with a dashboard with the option Add new site. Select this and follow the instructions:\n Add new site - Import an existing project  You will be presented with three options: GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Select GitHub  Next, you must authorize Netlify to grant access to your Git repositories. You can either grant access for all repositories or select a specific repo (ie your blog repo) Netlify will automatically recognize your project as a Hugo repo. I suggest keeping the options set to their defaults for now (see below)  Select deploy and wait for Netlify to build your website Once the build and deploy is completed, you should be able to access the link shown in your main site overview page  Now every time you commit new changes to your Git repo, Netlify will automatically build and redeploy with the latest updates!  Closing Congrats on making it this far. If you have any questions or concerns, please feel free to reach out using the contact page . Please share with anyone that might find this useful!!\n","wordCount":"1555","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-02-21T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-02-21T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Kyle McLester"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://kmclester.com/posts/hugo/create-blog/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Kyle's Blog","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://kmclester.com/favicon.ico"}}}</script>

<p>Something to note is that Hugo does <strong>not</strong> come with a theme out of the box. So, before you get started on creating the content of your pages, you will need to head to <a href=https://themes.gohugo.io/ target=_blank>
https://themes.gohugo.io/
</a> and choose a theme that fits your site.</p>
<p>I am using the <a href=https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod target=_blank>
PaperMod theme
</a>, created by <a href=https://github.com/adityatelange target=_blank>
Aditya Telange
</a>. For the sake of this demo, this is the theme that we will be using as it has a variety of features (search, categories, tags, etc) and it is pretty easy to get working.</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Start by cloning the theme&rsquo;s GitHub repository to your <code>themes</code> folder. This can be done a variety of ways but I prefer using GitHub&rsquo;s submodule feature - think of it like nested repositories.</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>git submodule add https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod.git themes/PaperMod --depth<span style=color:#f92672>=</span><span style=color:#ae81ff>1</span>
git submodule update --init --recursive <span style=color:#75715e># needed when you reclone your repo (submodules may not get cloned automatically)</span>
</code></pre></div><p>Once you have added the submodule, you should now see a new entry has been appended to your <code>.gitmodules</code> file and your <code>themes</code> folder now looks something like this:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>📂 themes
    📂 PaperMod
        📂 .github
        📂 assets
        📂 i18n
        📂 images
        📂 layouts
        📄 go.mod
        📄 LICENSE
        📄 README.md
</code></pre></div><p>If you ever need to update the theme, run:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>git submodule update --remote --merge
</code></pre></div></li>
<li>
<p>Next, we must alter the sites <code>config.yml</code> to use this new theme. The config file allows us to take advantage of the features that come bundled with the theme - and by setting certain variables, we can activate or modify these features. Below is an example of how I have my config setup but this is not the only way to do it, as you may need more or less features than I do. I strongly suggest checking if your theme has an example config file on the GitHub page that you downloaded the theme from.</p>

</code></pre></div><h2 id=serve-hugo-site-locally>Serve Hugo Site Locally<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#serve-hugo-site-locally>#</a></h2>
<p>To view the site on your local machine, simply run:</p>
<div class=highlight><pre tabindex=0 style=color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4><code class=language-bash data-lang=bash>hugo serve
</code></pre></div><p>Open <code>http://localhost:1313</code> in your browser, and you should be able to see the site live! Most themes come with default posts that can provide you with more information on how to use Hugo, the theme you selected, etc. - I would strongly recommend at least reading through some of these pages before creating your own content.</p>
<h2 id=creating-content>Creating Content<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#creating-content>#</a></h2>
<p>This is great but how do we actually make any webpages? The main folder that you will be working in is the <code>content</code> folder - this is where all of the pages/posts on your website will be kept.</p>
<p>Open the project directory in your favorite text editor or IDE - I&rsquo;m using VS Code for this project. Now, you can open any file in the <code>/content/posts</code> directory to begin editing files. Every time you save, the website will automatically update with the new content.</p>
<p>With this in mind, you can begin creating your own webpages.</p>
<p>Feel free to delete the included posts and begin making your own. Just remember, we are using markdown so you will need to create a new file with the <code>.md</code> file extension. Once you&rsquo;ve created your file, you will need to set the pages <a href=https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/ target=_blank>
&amp;ldquo;front matter&amp;rdquo;
</a>. The front matter is what allows you to attach meta data to your posts, as well as alter the configuration of a page. This is going to vary from theme to theme but I tend to use this for my pages:</p>

</code></pre></div><p>Note - the three dashes above and below the front matter are formatted for yaml code. Which symbol to use depends on the format of your config file. If you are using toml, you would use <code>+++</code> and json uses <code>{ }</code>.</p>
<p>The front matter should be followed by a single new line and then your content. Checkout <a href=https://github.com/kmcleste/personal-blog/blob/main/content/posts/hugo/create-blog.md target=_blank>
my github of this page

<p>Incase you haven&rsquo;t done so already, create a git repo for this project. As a quick refresher, feel free to follow the steps below:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to GitHub and create a new repo</li>
<li>In your root project directory, run <code>git init</code></li>
<li>Now add all of your files/changes by running <code>git add .</code></li>
<li>Commit your changes: <code>git commit -m "Initial commit"</code></li>
<li>Set branch to <strong>main</strong>: <code>git branch -M main</code></li>
<li>Add remote origin: <code>git remote add origin &lt;GIT_REPO_URL></code></li>
<li>Push changes to remote repo: <code>git push origin main</code></li>
</ol>
<p>Now head on over to <a href=https://netlify.com target=_blank>
Netlify
</a> and create an accout/login.</p>
<p>Once you have logged in, you should be greeted with a dashboard with the option <code>Add new site</code>. Select this and follow the instructions:</p>
<ol>
<li>Add new site -> Import an existing project
<img loading=lazy src=/posts/hugo/netlify-add-new.png alt="Netlify add new site">
</li>
<li>You will be presented with three options: GitHub, GitLab, or BitBucket. Select <code>GitHub</code>
<img loading=lazy src=/posts/hugo/import-existing.png alt="Import existing project">
</li>
<li>Next, you must authorize Netlify to grant access to your Git repositories. You can either grant access for all repositories or select a specific repo (ie your blog repo)</li>
<li>Netlify will automatically recognize your project as a Hugo repo. I suggest keeping the options set to their defaults for now (see below)
<img loading=lazy src=/posts/hugo/netlify-build.png alt="Netlify build options">
</li>
<li>Select deploy and wait for Netlify to build your website</li>
<li>Once the build and deploy is completed, you should be able to access the link shown in your main site overview page
<img loading=lazy src=/posts/hugo/deployed-site.png alt="Access newly deployed website">
</li>
<li>Now every time you commit new changes to your Git repo, Netlify will automatically build and redeploy with the latest updates!</li>
</ol>
